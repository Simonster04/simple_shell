.SH DESCRIPTION
.B the simple shell is a command processor that run in a text window, allowing the user to type commands. The commmands entered by the console will be executed in the program if the commands exit, returning a a succesfull process or a printed message to the user indicating if the process was successfull or it failed.

.SH ARGUMENTS
If hsh is invoked, $ is set to the name of the file, and the positional parameters are set to the remaining arguments. hsh reads and executes commands from this file, then exits. hsh exit status is the exit status of the last command executed in the script. If no commands are executed, the exit status is 0. An attempt is first made to open the file in the current directory, and, if no file is found, then the shell searches the directories in PATH for the script. 

.SH INVOCATION
To start the shell its necessary to execute the hsh program. When the shell is invoked as an interactive shell where the system logs in and open a terminal to type and execute commands. Also it can ve invoked as non-interactive, simply by teneting to the system, the shell eexecutes the command and exits automatically.

exit	Exits properly from the simple shell. The exit status of an executed command is the value returned by the waitpid system call or equivalent function. Exit statuses fall between 0 and 255, though, as explained below, the shell may use values above 125 specially. Exit statuses from shell builtins and compound commands are also limited to this range. Under certain circumstances, the shell will use special values to indicate specific failure modes.
